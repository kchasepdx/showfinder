        The concept of television was the work of many individuals in the late
        19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots initially starting from
        back even in the 18th century. The first practical transmissions of
        moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated
        disks to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be
        reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original
        image. Development of television was interrupted by the Second World
        War. After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning and
        displaying images became standard. Several different standards for
        addition of color to transmitted images were developed with different
        regions using technically incompatible signal standards. Television
        broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II, becoming an important
        mass medium for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment.[1]
        Television broadcasts can be distributed over the air by VHF and UHF
        radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations, by microwave
        signals from Earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to
        individual consumers by cable TV. Many countries have moved away from
        the original analog radio transmission methods and now use digital
        television standards, providing additional operating features and
        conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. Television
        programming can also be distributed over the Internet. Television
        broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue, by private or
        governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost, or in some
        countries, by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. Some
        services, especially carried by cable or satellite, are paid by
        subscriptions. Television broadcasting is supported by continuing
        technical developments such as long-haul microwave networks, which allow
        distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. Video recording
        methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use.
        Three-dimensional television has been used commercially but has not
        received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display
        methods.
